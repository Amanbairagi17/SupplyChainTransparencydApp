# Supply Chain Transparency dApp

## Project Description
The **Supply Chain Transparency dApp** is a decentralized application designed to enhance transparency in supply chains by recording each transaction and movement of goods on the Stellar blockchain. By leveraging smart contracts, the dApp ensures that supply chain data is accurate, immutable, and accessible to all stakeholders involved, promoting accountability and efficiency.

## Project Vision
The vision of the **Supply Chain Transparency dApp** is to revolutionize the way businesses and consumers view supply chains. Our goal is to provide a transparent, tamper-proof, and decentralized platform where the entire journey of a product, from raw materials to the final consumer, is recorded on the blockchain. This transparency promotes trust, reduces fraud, and allows all participants to verify the authenticity and ethical practices of the supply chain.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain-based Transparency**: Every transaction and movement of goods is recorded on the Stellar blockchain, making the data immutable and accessible.
- **Smart Contract Enforcement**: Smart contracts ensure that data is recorded accurately and only by authorized participants.
- **Decentralized Access**: All stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers, have real-time access to supply chain data.
- **Fraud Prevention**: The immutable nature of blockchain technology helps prevent fraud and ensures the integrity of the data.
- **Efficiency and Accountability**: Improved tracking reduces delays and errors in supply chains, while ensuring that all participants are held accountable for their role.
